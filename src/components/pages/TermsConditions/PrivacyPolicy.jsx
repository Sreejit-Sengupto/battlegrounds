          underage users should not use the Game and/or Service unless parental
          consent is provided. We do not knowingly collect, use or share any
          personal information for those who are under 18 years of age without
          the consent and verification of the underage users’ parent or
          guardian, or unless permitted by law. If you are under the age of 18
          years, you will be asked to provide the mobile phone number of your
          parent or guardian to confirm that you are legally eligible to play
          the game. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child
          under 18 years of age has provided us with their personal information
          without your consent, you can contact us and request that your child’s
          information be deleted from our system.
